-Make a new commit and push with every major change. (Ask user which branch to push to if unsure.)
-Verify all builds succeed in XCode after making major/minor changes. 
-After changes, add appropriate files to XCode. Do not ask the user to do this. 
-When interacting with or having issues with the external server API at (10.69.1.250), make sure to use the server-browser MCP available to you to check the server directly. Also get back to me on any issues you had with the MCP and high-level solutions so I can improve it. 
-Documents are in the Docs folder in the Documents on Home for reference.
